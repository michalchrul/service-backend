# Reddit-like service backend

A backbone for a reddit-like service allowing users to post content in different threads (just as in subreddits) as well as liking/unliking the content
(more like on facebook rather than with the redditâ€™s voting system).

Built with Java 8 with Maven and Spring. Deployed to Microsoft Azure. CosmosDB for storage and Redis for application-level caching.
